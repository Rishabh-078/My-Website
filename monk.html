The story revolves around Julian, a very successful lawyer that has never lost any case and has bought all riches that a wealthy man wants. These include a big mansion, jet, and Ferrari, despite all these things he wasn't satisfied as he wanted more. So, he started working 18 hours a day, ignoring everyone and everything besides his work and due to which his marriage broke off, he started looking much older than he was. During a case hearing, a severe heart attack happened and the doctor advised him to quit his job, get relieved from stress, and live remaining life peacefully. He felt like despite winning all cases, he failed the case about his life. After deeply introspecting about his mistakes, he took a bold step by selling all his luxuries including the "Ferrari" and left toward a journey to find the true meaning of life. His journey took him to the Himalayans where famous Indian Monks with the highest level of wisdom resided. Julian came to know about these monks that they live happily for more than 100 years with the energy of young people.<br>
After many struggles, while climbing treacherous heights, he met one of the monks who after listening to Julian's story agreed to take him to his village. Julian started to live with them and observing their lifestyle. Julian with his dedication made the monk leader agree to teach him "Principles of Life" on the simple condition that Julian will take these teachings with him and spread them among others. Monk leader narrated a story to teach him about the principle and the story goes like this:<br><br>
<strong> Imagine you are sitting in a beautiful garden that has different types of trees and colorful fragrant flowers, with many birds chirping around. There stands a lighthouse in the middle of the garden and suddenly the door of the lighthouse creeks opens and a sumo wrestler comes out of the door just wearing underwear made up of thin wires. He wanders around and finds a golden watch lying there in the garden. When he tries to pick the watch up, he slipped and fell to the ground lying motionless. After some time he gets back to his senses, probably due to the fragrance of flowers, and gets up. After getting up he looked on his left, where he can see a path paved out of a small diamond and this path led to a place where one finds all his happiness in his life. Sumo wrestler starts walking on this path and later get out of sight.</strong><br><br>

Monk leader said that this story contains the seven biggest principles of life. These principles are summarized below:<br><br>
<strong>1. Garden</strong>  in the story symbolizes our mind, as in garden if we sow good seeds and take care of the garden it will result in good fruits and flower-bearing plants and trees, on the other hand, if we throw garbage and don't take care of the garden, it will eventually become a dump. Similarly with our minds if we sow good and positive thoughts, we will flourish as the garden and help us achieve greater heights but if we surround ourselves with negative and demotivated things we will be converted to toxic human beings, always complaining and in a spoilt mood. Some of the techniques to strengthen your mind:<br>
(a.) Heart of Rose: Hold a rose sitting in a quiet place and start concentrating on the heart of the rose, its color, shape, and all things. At the start, other thoughts will come rushing in, but after some time, you will only be concentrated on the rose and your mind will be more controlled. <br>
(b.) Opposition Thinking: Whenever a negative thought comes into your mind, try replacing it immediately with any other positive thought as we don't want any negative thought polluting our garden.<br>
(c.) The secret of Lake: We must imagine ourselves as the person we want and desire to be, as in a lake we see our reflection, by imagining what we long, we will lead to being the same person we imagine to be.  <br><br>
<strong>(2.)Lighthouse:</strong>Lighthouse in the story symbolizes goals in our life. As the lighthouse shows the direction to the sailing ships, we should choose the right path in our life. We must set defined personal and professional goals and act on them. A 5-step procedure towards following our purpose is:<br>
Form a clear mental image of the outcome.<br>
(a.) Implement positive pressure on ourselves, so that we work towards our goals.<br>
(b.) Always set goals with a timeline.<br>
(c.) Don't forget to have fun along the path.<br>
(d.) Magic Rule of 21(days), which means that a person requires 21days to adopt a new habit.<br><br>
<strong>(3.)Sumo wrestler:</strong> Sumo Wrestler in the story symbolizes Kaizen ("Japanese Word") which means continuous learning and improvement. As the saying goes "Self-mastery is life mastery", "Success on outside begins within" and "Enlightenment comes through cultivation of mind, body, and soul", we must work toward strengthening and improving ourselves. To improve we must follow 10 rituals namely Solitude, Physicality, Live Nourishment, Abundant Knowledge, Personal Reflection, Early Awakening, Music, Spoken Word, Congruent Character, and Simplicity.<br><br>
<strong>(4.)Pink Cable Wire:</strong> Pink Cable Wire in the story symbolizes Self Control and Discipline. Underwear with cable might be small but without it, wrestlers will be naked, similarly, small acts of courage help built discipline. The more we nurture the embryo of our self-discipline, the more it will mature. Our willpower and discipline can be strengthened by chanting Mantras and by opting Vow of Silence. One such mantra is "I am more than I appear to be, all the world's power and strength rest inside me."<br><br>
<strong>(5.)Stopwatch:</strong>  Stopwatch in the story symbolizes time. No matter how rich or poor, every person has the same 24hrs so we must utilize them effectively as it can decide that we will be happy or sad at the end of the day. Time is the most precious commodity available. Time is non-renewable, some must focus on priorities and maintain balance. We must know the ancient rule of 80-20 which says that 80% of achieved results come from 20% of the activities we do. To avoid wasting time, we must have the courage to say 'No'.<br><br>
<strong>(6.)Fragrant Roses:</strong> Yellow Fragrant Roses in the story symbolize Selflessly serving others. We must always up for social service and work towards helping others in need as by elevating the lives of others our lives reach higher dimensions. The quality of your life ultimately comes down to the quality of your contributions. We can achieve it by practicing the daily act of kindness and cultivating richer relationships.<br><br>
<strong>(7.)Diamond's Path:</strong> Diamond Path in the story symbolizes embracing the present. One must live and embrace a small moment of happiness that comes in his day-to-day life and must not get disturbed by thinking about our past or future. These moments can be quality time with family or living our kid's childhood. We must savor our journey and live our life as our last and thus never sacrifice happiness for achievement.<br><br>
